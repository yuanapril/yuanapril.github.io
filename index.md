## About Me

<!-- Hi! I'm YUAN Mei (<font face="楷体">袁 玫</font>)!  -->
Hi! I'm YUAN Mei (<font face=楷体 color=black size=5>袁 玫</font>)! I received my Master's degree in Computational Lingustic Engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a>, where I was fortunately supervised by Prof. LI Boting and worked closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9f4JUrUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. SU Qi</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information System.

During my postgraduate studies, I interned at Meituan and Apple Inc., where I led several innovative projects focused on LLMs for the sales sector(i.e LLM-powered customer service, data analysis, skill learning). Additionally, I co-founded <a href="http://textpanda.cn">TextPanda</a>, an intelligent Chinese writing assistant powered by our cutting-edge Chinese Spelling Check model ’**Zous-1B**’.

<br />

My primary research interest lies in (Multimodal) Large Language Models for **human-centered** scenarios. Specifically:

- **AI-assisted training and practice**
<!--- **Building adaptive pedagogical systems with multimodal coaching avatars** to enable (M)LLMs simulating educators and learners to reshape the pedagogy and acquisition process. -->
  Building adaptive tutoring systems with specialized support for human-in-the-loop interactive paradigms to assist education and human learning.

- **Generate interleaved-modal and controllable story-like narratives and illustrations** in a unified manner, allowing for interaction with users on a self-built dynamic storyboard.
  
- **Explore unified MLLMs for Comprehension and Creation** which learn both language and vision posteriors simultaneously and generate free-form interleaved content.
