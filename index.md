Hi! I'm YUAN Mei (<span style="font-family:'KaiTi', 'STKaiti', 'Kaiti SC', serif;">袁 玫</span>)! I received my Master's degree in Computational Lingustic Engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a>, where I was fortunately supervised by Prof. LI Boting and worked closely with <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9f4JUrUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. SU Qi</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information System.

During my postgraduate studies, I interned at Meituan and Apple Inc., where I led several pilot projects focused on LLMs for the sales sector (i.e LLM-assisted customer service, data analysis, skill learning). Additionally, I co-founded <a href="http://textpanda.cn">TextPanda</a>, an intelligent Chinese writing assistant powered by our Chinese Spelling Check model '**Zous-1B**'.

<br />

My primary research interest lies in (Multimodal) Large Language Models for **human-centered** scenarios. Specifically:

- <img src="imgs/icon1.jpeg" alt="icon" style="width:30px;height:30px;vertical-align:middle;"> **Intelligent skill learning**.

  Build adaptive tutoring systems with specialized support for human-in-the-loop interactive paradigms to assist education and human learning.

- <img src="imgs/icon2.jpeg" alt="icon" style="width:30px;height:30px;vertical-align:middle;"> **Creative and controllable storytelling**.
   
  Generate visual-linguistic intertwined and controllable narratives and illustrations in a unified manner, allowing for interaction with users on a self-built dynamic storyboard.

- <img src="imgs/multisense.png" alt="icon" style="width:30px;height:30px;vertical-align:middle;"> **Unified MLLMs for Comprehension and Creation**.
  
  Learn both language and vision posteriors simultaneously and generate free-form interleaved content.
