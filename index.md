## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/profile.jpeg">

Hi! I'm YUAN Mei (<font face="KAI">袁 玫</font>)! I received my Master's degree in Computational Lingustic Engineering from <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn">Peking University</a>, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. LI Boting and worked closedly with <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9f4JUrUAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. SU Qi</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information System and interned at Meituan and Apple Inc. leading the LLMs for sales project.

My primary research interest lies in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Specifically:

- **Multimodal Language Grounding.** Vision-language generative systems (tools) are built to produce customized and diverse outputs, e.g. fictionally visual storytelling.

- **Controllable & Creative Content Generation.** Vision-language generative systems (tools) are built to produce customized and diverse outputs, e.g. fictionally visual storytelling.
  
- **Interdisciplinary Applications.** Employ computational methods to push the boundaries of formidable practical scenarios in realms of education, archaeology, fine art, etc.
